The Luna 17 mission targeting a landing on the near side of the moon was launched on the 3rd of August, 1963 towards a 180km, 42 degree circular orbit.  The first stage suffered a malfunction with one engine shutting down halfway through its burns, fortunately, the gimbals were able to correct for this loss of thrust and the vehicle continued with its ascent. The vehicle successfully entered orbit 6 minutes and 12 seconds after liftoff. The Pegasus-C kick stage then successfully sent the spacecraft on a path to the Moon. A small correction was made to target the landing for Oceanus Procellarum. Two breaking burns later the spacecraft successfully landed on the lunar surface.
