The Svet 15 is a commercial communications satellite targeting a tundra orbit. It also functions as a scientific satellite for the space program as it gathers helpful information on orbital perturbations. Launched on the 20th of April 1963, it is initially targeting a 180km, 116.6 degree inclination orbit. A minor guidance error caused the spacecraft to enter an eccentric parking orbit but this is within fuel tolerances. A burn using the Pegasus-B kick stage was plotted to raise the apogee to meet contract parameters. The spacecraft was inserted into its target orbit, spun up for stability, and separated from the transfer stage.
