Pioneer 3 spacecraft is an early scientific mission targeting a flyby of the planet Mercury. It was launched into a 180 km, 39.6 degree inclination parking orbit on the 7th of October 1963. Upon reaching orbit, it waited a day for the optimal transfer time and the Pegasus-C kick stage successfully placed the spacecraft into a Mercury transfer orbit. A small correction by the spacecraft was completed 3 days later to fine tune the approach from 27,000 km to 100km above the surface. The spacecraft arrived at Mercury on ___
