The Luna 16 mission was launched on June 10th 1963 towards a 180km, 41.30 degree inclination orbit. The first stage fired successfully but the third stage experienced an engine failure in the vernier thrusters and the vehicle lost control. The range safety system was triggered, terminating the mission with debris falling over the Pacific Ocean.
