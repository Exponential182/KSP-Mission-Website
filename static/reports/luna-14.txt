The Luna 14 mission was launched on March 1st 1963 towards a 180km, 45.96 degree inclination orbit. The first stage fired successfully but the second stage experienced an engine failure and the vehicle lost control. It was attempted to fire the third stage and transfer stage to place the vehicle into a useful communications orbit, but issues with the guidance system caused this to fail. The vehicleâ€™s flight was terminated 5 to 6 minutes after launch.
