The Luna 18 mission targeting a landing on the near side of the moon was launched on the 16th of October 1963 towards a 180km, 46 degree circular orbit. The UR-350A vehicle successfully placed the transfer vehicle into its target orbit with no malfunctions. The vehicle successfully entered orbit 6 minutes and 12 seconds after liftoff. The Pegasus-C kick stage then successfully sent the spacecraft on a path to the Moon. A ~25 m/s burn was made with RCS to target a landing in Mare Imbrium. After 2 breaking burns and an incident with the payload being over-fueled, preventing direct control, the spacecraft successfully landed in Mare Imbrium.
