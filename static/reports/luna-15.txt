The Luna 15 mission was launched on the 12th of April 1963 into a 180km, 44.58 degree inclination orbit. All stages of the launch vehicle fired successfully and placed the payload into a parking orbit. The payload deployed communications dishes and plotted a burn using its Pegasus-C kick stage to transfer it to a lunar impact trajectory. 3 days later, upon arrival at the moon, a small 14 m/s burn was completed to target the landing to the lunar lowlands. 2 successful breaking burns were performed by the transfer stage to lower the vehicle speed to ~50 m/s. A minor mishap occurred with the attitude of the payload in the early stages however software corrected this and the vehicle was once more under control. The mission then successfully landed in the lunar lowlands.
