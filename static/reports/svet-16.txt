Svet 16 is a commercial communications satellite targeting a tundra orbit. It also functions as a scientific satellite for the space program as it gathers helpful information on orbital perturbations. Launched on the 9th of September 1963, it is initially targeting a 180km, 63.4 degree inclination orbit. The spacecraft entered its parking orbit to relative success, a minor issue with automatic guidance systems caused them to disable and the final orbital insertion was completed by ground operators. Two burns of the Pegasus-B kick stage successfully place the satellite into its target orbit.
