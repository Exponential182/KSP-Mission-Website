The first stage fired successfully, but the second stage experienced an engine failure, and the vehicle lost control. Attempts to fire the third stage and transfer stage to place the vehicle into a useful communications orbit failed due to guidance issues.

All stages of the launch vehicle fired successfully and placed the payload into a parking orbit. The payload deployed communications dishes and plotted a burn using its Pegasus-C kick stage to transfer it to a lunar impact trajectory. 3 days later, upon arrival at the moon, a small 14 m/s burn was completed to target the landing in the lunar lowlands. 2 successful braking burns were performed by the transfer stage to lower the vehicle speed to ~50 m/s. A minor mishap occurred with the attitude of the payload in the early stages, however, software corrected this, and the vehicle was once more under control.

It also functions as a scientific satellite for the space program, as it gathers helpful information on orbital perturbations. Launched on the 20th of April 1963, it initially targeted a 180km, 116.6 degree inclination orbit. A minor guidance error caused the spacecraft to enter an eccentric parking orbit, but this is within fuel tolerances. A burn using the Pegasus-B kick stage was plotted to raise the apogee to meet contract parameters.

The first stage suffered a malfunction with one engine shutting down halfway through its burns. Fortunately, the gimbals were able to correct for this loss of thrust and the vehicle continued with its ascent. The vehicle successfully entered orbit 6 minutes and 12 seconds after liftoff. The Pegasus-C kick stage then successfully sent the spacecraft on a path to the Moon. A small correction was made to target the landing for Oceanus Procellarum.

Upon reaching orbit, it waited a day for the optimal transfer time, and the Pegasus-C kick stage successfully placed the spacecraft into a Mercury transfer orbit. A small correction by the spacecraft was completed 3 days later to fine-tune the approach from 27,000 km to 100km above the surface.

The UR-200A launch vehicle performs nominally and places the Pegasus-B kick stage and the spacecraft into its parking orbit. A small burn is performed to raise the apogee to match the final orbital periapsis.

The Pegasus-B kick stage performed a 3132m/s burn to place the spacecraft onto a translunar trajectory. An oversight with the mission design means that the spacecraft has no control beyond Earth and cannot successfully perform its capture manoeuvre.
